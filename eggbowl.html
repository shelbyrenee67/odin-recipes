            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Spread tater tots on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 8 mins. Flip them over and bake until crispy brown, about another 8 mins.</li>
            <li>While they bake, combine eggs, salsa, and milk in a bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat and coat with olive oil. Add in the egg mixture and any other optional toppings of your choosing (Dont add the green onion or bell pepper yet). Scramble until partially set, about 2 mins. Now add the green onion and bell pepper and cook until fully set, about 5 mins. Transfer eggs to a plate.</li>
            <li>Place tater tots in a large bowl and top with the scrambled eggs and grated cheddar cheese. Add salt and pepper and other seasonings and serve hot.</li>
