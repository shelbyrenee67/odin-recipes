Build a basic recipe website using HTML
In this project, I will implement what I have learned about HTML so far and build a recipe website. I am hoping to 1. structure my website using HTML components properly 2. add absolute and relative links to my website 3. practice the use of various headings and understand their meaning and 4. add images to my website 
After the website is built, I will return to these goals and determine if I was successfull in accomplishing them over the course of this project.
